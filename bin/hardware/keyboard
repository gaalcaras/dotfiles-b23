# KEYBOARD SETUP
# Expected behaviour :
# - CapsLock works as Escape when used on its own and as control when used in
#   combination with other keys
# - Tab works normally but is Hyper when used in combination with other keys
# - w works normally but is Hyper when used in combination with other keys

# Find keyboards ID
thinkpad=$(xinput list | grep "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" | grep -o 'id=[0-9]*' | cut -d = -f 2)
typematrix=$(xinput list | grep "TypeMatrix.com USB" | grep -v "Control" | grep -o 'id=[0-9]*' | cut -d = -f 2)

# Setup keyboard with xkb only :
# - EVERYTHING :
#    - Map Tab to HyperL (Tab when pressed once)
#    - Map w to HyperR (w when pressed once)
# - THINKPAD :
#    - Use CapsLock as Control (Escape when pressed once)
# - TYPEMATRIX :
#    - Use Delete Key as Escape

# For some reason, xcape does not seem to handle keyboard specific settings, so
# we need some general mapping first
xkbcomp -w3 "-I$HOME/.xkb" "$HOME/.xkb/keymap/custom" "$DISPLAY"

# Then use xcape to define behaviour when short press (<300ms)

# For main laptop keyboard (id=3, run xinput to find it)

# For external TypeMatrix keyboard (id=18, run xinput to find it)
