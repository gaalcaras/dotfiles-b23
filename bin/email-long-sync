# Syncing email command with offlineimap:
#   -o run only once
#   -u choose interface to be quiet except in case of errors
#   -l log it to file
sync_email="offlineimap -o -u quiet -l $HOME/.offlineimap-cron.log"

# Send emails in queue with msmtp-runqueue
send_email="msmtp-runqueue.sh"

# Exit if we're offline
if ! ping -c1 www.google.com > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo 'No ping from Google...'
    # But ping could be firewalled ...

    # '-O -' will redirect the actual html to stdout and thus to /dev/null
    if ! wget -O - www.google.com > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        # Both test have failed
        echo 'No website at google.com...'
        echo "We're either offline or Google has been vanquished by Framasoft"
