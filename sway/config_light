# sway configuration
# by @gaalcaras
#
# Since I wanted to be able to switch from a solarized dark to light theme with
# a single key mapping ($mod+b), I had to organize my sway config files a bit
# differently:
#
#   + config_local is for general settings, shared accross dark and light themes
#   + dark / light files address theme specific configuration
#   + use bin/theme_switch to switch between a light / dark config. Most
#     importantly, it will concatenate the general setting with the relevant
#     theme-specific file to the sway config file.
#   + use bin/swayreload to reload sway config.
#
# You should NOT directly edit your sway config file, as changes could be lost
# after switching themes. Use this file instead ;-)
